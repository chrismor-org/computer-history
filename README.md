This is really just for fun as a way of teaching myself about Graph Databases.

The code will probably make others laugh or cry but that's OK, I have to start somewhere.

There are no doubt omissions and mistakes, create a PR if you wish to correct or add anything.

On the off chance this is actually useful to someone, how about a shout-out in your completed work?

Thank you.
